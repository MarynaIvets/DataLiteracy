Where do you start? First, you need to find a research question that interests you and formulate a hypothesis. We will introduce some key terminology, steps you can undertake and examples how to develop research questions. Note that there is no single best way to develop a research idea (Pischke 2012). What if someone assigns a topic to me? For students attending undergraduate and graduate courses that often pick topics from a list, all of these steps are equally important and necessary. You still need to formulate a research question and a hypothesis. And it is important to clarify the relevance of your topic for yourself. 2.1.1 What is a hypothesis? A hypothesis is a statement that introduces your research question and suggests the results you might find in your research. You will test your hypothesis with your empirical analysis. Thus, hypothesis constitutes the main basis of your scientific investigation. You should be careful when creating it. A hypothesis is an educated guess. You start by posing an economic question and formulate a hypothesis about this question. Then you test it with your data and analyses and either accept or reject the hypothesis. 2.1.2 How do you develop a research question and formulate a hypothesis? When thinking about a research question (Trochim n.d.), you need to identify a topic that is Relevant, important in the world and interesting to you as researcher: Does working on the topic excites you? You will spend many hours working on it. Therefore, it should be interesting and engaging enough for you to motivate your continued work on this topic. Specific: not too broad and not too narrow Feasible to research within a given timeframe: Is it possible to answer the research question based on your time budget, data and additional resources. How do you find a topic or develop a feasible research idea in the first place? Finding an idea is not difficult, the critical part is to find a good idea. How do you do that? There is no one specific way how one gets an idea, rather there is a myriad of ways how people come up with potential ideas (Varian 2016). Once you decide on an idea, run it by a few people. That means approach your supervisor and other fellow students to see whether it is interesting enough to pursue it. For example, you can find inspiration by Looking at insights from the world around you: your own life and experiences, observe the behavior of people around you Talking to people around you, experts, other students, family members Talking to individuals outside your field (non-economists) Talking to professionals working in the area you are investigating (you may use social media and professional platforms like LinkedIN or Twitter to make contact) Reading journal articles from other non-economic social sciences and the medical literature Reading economic and non-economic newspaper and magazine articles (e.g. Süddeutsche, Frankfurter Allgemeine, Tagesspiegel, The Economist, the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian), watching TV programs What are the issues being discussed? How do these issues affect peoples lives? You could in addition Go to virtual and in-person seminars, for example the Essen Health Economics Seminar Look at abstracts of scientific articles and working papers Look at the literature in a specific field you are interested in, for example sceening complete issues of journals or editorials about certain research advancements. By reading this literature you might come up with the idea on how to extend and refine previous research. 2.1.3 Develop a Hypothesis Before you formulate your hypothesis, read up on the topic of interest. This reading should provide you with sufficient information to narrow down your research question. The research question comes from the topic you are contemplating. Once you find your question you need to develop a hypothesis. A hypothesis is your research question distilled into a one sentence statement. It presents a statement of your expectations regarding your research questions results. You propose to prove your hypothesis with your research by testing the relationship between two variables of interest. Thus, a hypothesis should be testable with the data at hand. There are two types of hypotheses: alternative or null. Null states that there is no effect. Alternative states that there is an effect. It should be noted that there is an alternative view on this that suggests one should not look at the literature too early on in the idea-generating process in order not to be influenced and shaped by someone elses ideas. According to this view you can spend some time (i.e. a few weeks) trying to develop your own original idea. Even if you end up with an idea that has already been pursued by someone else, this will still provide you with good practice in developing publishable ideas. After you have developed an idea and made sure that it was not yet investigated in the literature, you can start conducting a systematic literature review. By doing this, you can find some other interesting insights from the work of others that you can synthesize in your own work to produce something novel and original. 2.1.4 Identify Relevant Literature For your research project you will need to identify and collect previous relevant literature. It should involve a thorough search of the keywords in relevant databases and journals. Place emphasis on articles from high-ranking journals with significant numbers of citations. This will give you an indication of the most influential and important work in the field. Once you identify and collect the relevant literature for your topic, you will need to critically synthesize it in your literature review. When you perform your literature review, consider theories that may inform your research question. For example when studying physician behavior, you may consider approaches made using principal-agency theory. 2.1.5 Research question or literature review, a hen and egg problem? Whether you start reading the literature first or by developing an idea may depend on your stage (graduate student, early career researcher) and other goals. However, thinking freely about what you like to investigate first may help to critically develop a feasible and interesting research question. We highlight an example how to start with investigating the real-world and subsequently posing a research question (How to Write a Strong Hypothesis Steps and Examples 2019; Developing Strong Research Questions Criteria and Examples 2019; Schilbach 2019). For example, based on your own observation you notice that people seem to spend extensive amount of time looking at their smartphones. Maybe even you yourself engage in the same behavior. In addition, you read a BBC News article Social media damages teenagers mental health, report says. Figure 2.2: social_media Source: BBC You decided to translate this article and your observations into a research question. A research question could be: How does daily social media use influence our mental health? Before you formulate your hypothesis, read up on the topic of interest. This reading should provide you with sufficient information to narrow down your research question. Read economic, medical and other social science literature on the topic. There is likely to be a vast amount of non-econ literature from non-econ fields that are doing research on your topic of interest, for example psychology or neuroscience. Familiarize yourself with it and master it. Do not get distracted by different scientific methodologies and techniques that might seem not up-to-par to the economic studies (small sample sizes, endogeneity, uncovering association rather than causation, etc.), but rather focus on suggestions of potential mechanisms. A hypothesis is then your research question distilled into a one sentence statement. It presents a statement of your expectations regarding your research questions results. You propose to prove your hypothesis with your research by testing the relationship between two variables of interest. Thus, a hypothesis should be testable with the data at hand. There are two types of hypotheses: alternative or null. The null* hypothesis states that there is no effect. The alternative hypothesis states that there is an effect. A hypothesis related to the above-stated research question could be: The increased use of social media among teenagers leads to (is associated with) worse mental health outcomes, i.e. increased incidence of depression, worse well-being and lower self-esteem. Your hypothesis suggests a direction of a relationship that you expect to find. It is not a blind guess, but is guided by your observations and existing evidence, that means the reports that you have collected. It is testable with scientific research methods, that means by using statistical analysis of the relevant data. Your hypothesis suggests a relationship between two variables: social media use (your independent variable \\(X\\)) and mental health (dependent variable \\(Y\\)). Note, that this hypothesis could be framed in terms of correlation (is associated with) or causation (leads to). This should be reflected in the choice of scientific investigation you decide to undertake. The null hypothesis is: There is no relationship between social media use among teenagers and their mental health. It should be noted that there is an alternative view on this idea - a hypothesis-generating process that suggests that one should not look at the literature too early on in the idea-generating process not to be influenced and shaped by someone elses ideas. According to this view you can spend some time like a few weeks trying to develop your own original idea. Even if you end up with an idea that has already been pursued by someone else and published, this will still provide you with good practice in developing publishable ideas. After you have developed an idea and made sure that it was not yet investigated in the literature, you can start conducting a systematic literature review. By doing this, you can find some other interesting insights from the work of others that you can synthesize in your own work to produce something novel and original. 2.2 Resources box 2.2.1 How to develop strong research questions The form of the research process 2.2.2 Identify relevant literature from major general interest and field literature To identify the relevant literature you can use academic search engines such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, EconLit, PubMed.
