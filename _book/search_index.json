If there is no chance to replicate research results, they can be regarded as no more than personal views in the opinion or review section of a daily newspaper. (Huschka 2013) 1.1 What is reproducible research? Scientific journal editors and research funders are increasingly promoting transparency in research. To encourage the principles of reproducible research, the related institutions are requesting authors to make their research reproducible. To overcome criticisms regarding the validity and power of empirical tests, this means that data and program code need to be shared upon manuscript acceptance, or earlier stages of the submission process. The purpose is that third-parties have the possibility to reproduce the content and analysis of a study, and conclusions of a study on their own. Efforts to increase reproducability have been expressed by multiple institutions within the social sciences, for example: The best practices statement by the Social Science Data Editors, In Germany, by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Consortium for the Social, Behavioural, Educational and Economic Sciences RatWSD In editorial statement of journals, for example American Economic Review, Management Science or the Journal of International Business Studies (Meyer, Witteloostuijn, and Beugelsdijk 2017; Orozco et al. 2020) Generally, reproducibility of research can be defined as the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials and procedures as were used by the original investigator. In an attempt to reproduce a published statistical analysis, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis to determine whether they yield the same results. (Bollen et al. 2015). Study results are considered reproducible if after an article publication another researcher can conduct the analyses using identical data and obtain the same results using the material provided. Since empirical economic research is based on the application of a code to a dataset to answer a pre-defined research question, ensuring the reproducibility includes sharing the data and code to allow others to re-analyze the data and to reproduce the reported results (Orozco et al. 2020). To achieve this, the data and code need to be properly managed while working on a project. Another concept closely related to reproducibility is the concept of replicability that refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected. (Bollen et al. 2015). Thus, for example, if an investigator tries to replicate a scientific finding that documents a relationship between two or more variables by using the same scientific methodology but in a new setting, i.e. with new data, and fails and to reach a similar conclusion, i.e. replicate it  a failure to replicate occurs. The opposite is said to be true if the results are replicated. Thus, reproducibility and replicability are considered to be the two main elements of empirical research. To adapt reproducible practices early on, undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to perform reproducible research in their term papers, theses, and practical applications as soon as possbile. For this reason, university teachers are increasingly asking to submit reproduction material (source data information, data programming and analysis code) at all stages of study. The concept of reproducible research is not new and goes back as far as the late 1800s (Vilhuber 2020). However, reproducibility studies have disclosed that many rearchers do not follow the principles of reproducible research. At the same time, the increase in availability and use of public and especially non-public data sources, and the increase in the reliance of research methods based on specific software bringing the principles of reproducible research on the agenda of many researchers. The resources box in each chapter provides material of best practices in data and code management to perform a reproducible research project, as well as provides resources for best practices in cleaning the data and conducting data analysis. 1.2 Why you, as a student and researcher, should care about reproducible research? 1.2.1 Avoid common biases that lead to biased or false research results There is a number of threats to reproducible research process that can undermine scientific research or lead to false or biased conclusions and publications, see, e.g. ?? illustrating main threats to reproducible science (Munafò et al. 2017). Figure 1.1: munafo 1.2.2 Increase productivity of your work and the work of the scientific community by performing reproducible research Following the reproducible research principles allows you to be a part of a good academic practice that strives to improve the quality, efficiency and reliability of scientific research. 1.3 Main steps to produce reproducible research To follow the best practices of reproducible research, you will need to consider how to perform your project and the steps a reproducible research project contains. There are three main principles to enhance reproducible research (Orozco et al. 2020): Organize your work: consider and plan your steps at the beginning of the project Code for others: set up each step of your project such that an outsider could follow your documentation Automate as much as you can: avoid processing analyses and results using point-and-click softare (MS Excel), export results directly and create a reproducible project documentation. In this study guide we follow the main steps of performing a reproducible data science project (Bezjak et al. 2018). To make your empirical research study process reproducible, you need to follow these five steps (Figure ??): Formulating a hypothesis (Section 2) Designing the study (Section 3) Running the study and collecting the data (Section 4) Analyzing the data (Section 5) Reporting the study (Section 6) Figure 1.2: reproducible 1.4 Secondary (health care) data This study guide concentrates on empirical investigation using secondary data, that means data that is not originally collected or generated by the researcher for the purpose of the study. Secondary data covers any existing data generated by companies, institutions, and individuals. Examples of secondary data sources are routinelly collected health data (administrative claims, electronic medical records), bibliometric data, survey data, regulatory data, data generated in mobile applications. 1.5 Creating an environment for productive research projects Before you start running the study you should assess your available resources, that means time and own expertise to see whether the study design is feasible. If there is an opportunity to work collaboratively and you think that the project can benefit from the expertise of another researcher, you can approach the person and ask whether they would be interested to work together on the project. Joining resources might relax your resource availability contraints. It may further ensure that you engage in a reproducible research process. 1.6 Resources Box An overview article of the principles of reproducible reserach and practical application: Orozco V, Bontemps C, Maigné E, Piguet V, Hofstetter A, Lacroix A, et al. How to Make a Pie: Reproducible Research for Empirical Economics and Econometrics.
