	abstract = {Health care payers try to reduce costs by promoting the use of cheaper generic drugs. We show strong interrelations in drug prescriptions between the inpatient and outpatient sectors by using a large administrative dataset from Austria. Patients with prior hospital visits have a significantly lower probability of receiving a generic drug in the outpatient sector. The size of the effect depends on both the patient and doctor characteristics, which could be related to the differences in hospital treatment and heterogeneity in the physicians' adherence to hospital choices. Our results suggest that hospital decisions create spillover costs in health care systems with separate funding for inpatient and outpatient care.},

	abstract = {To identify the inﬂuences on the diffusion of generics after patent expiry, we analyzed 65 generic entries using prescription data of a large German sickness fund between 2007 and 2012 in a sales model. According to theory, several elements are responsible for technology diffusion: (1) time reﬂecting the rate of adaption within the social system, (2) communication channels, and (3) the degree of incremental innovation, e.g., the modiﬁcations of existing active ingredient’s strength. We investigated diffusion in two ways: (1) generic market share (percentage of generic prescriptions of all prescriptions of a substance) and, (2) generic sales quantity (number of units sold) over time. We speciﬁed mixed regression models. Generic diffusion takes considerable time. An average generic market share of about 75 \% was achieved not until 48 months. There was a positive effect of time since generic entry on generic market share (p {\textbackslash} 0.001) and sales (p {\textbackslash} 0.001). Variables describing the communication channels and the degree of innovation inﬂuenced generic market share (mostly p {\textbackslash} 0.001), but not generic sales quantity. Market structure, e.g., the number of generic manufacturers (p {\textbackslash} 0.001) and prices inﬂuenced both generic market share and sales. Imperfections in generic uptake through informational cascades seem to be largely present. Thirdparty payers could enhance means to promote generic diffusion to amplify savings through generic entry.},
