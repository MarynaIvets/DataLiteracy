Data Science Campus - A study guide for reproducible research using secondary (health care) data

The objective of this study guide is to provide a resource to graduate students, early career PhD candidates and researchers performing applied empirical research in economics and management sciences. The pratical application is in the field of analysis of health care markets using secondary data. Many textbook examples use readily available datasets for analysis of econometric problems. For students aiming to conduct research by generating their own analysis dataset, important steps that lead to a final analysis dataset are missing. Besides, many resources focus on labor economics problems. Resources that consider processing and generating secondary data are scarce. One reason is that often these data sources are subject to confientiality and data protection issues and as such these cannot be made easily available.

The objective of this study guide is to provide a resource that covers the major parts of a reproducible research project in 5 steps. We will introduce important terminology, highlight the relevant tasks to be performed, and to provide key resources in the form of text books and websites available via open access. We aim to provide a concise guide that user can easily access when starting academic research. Each section can be read within 10-15 minutes. For this reason, we will not cover any specific data science or econometric method, but point to the relevant resources. Therefore, users of this guide should have basic knowledge in statistics, econometrics and program evaluation. We further recommend basic knowledge in a statistical package such as R or Stata. For the study guide to be of most benefit, readers should have background knowledge and a research idea in mind while reading.

## Learning objectives

The goal is to set up and carry out a data science project using secondary data. Students will learn all steps starting with hypothesis formulation, data generation and analysis, and presentation of empirical results.

After reading and applying the principles introduced in this study guide, you will be able to:

1. Recognize the features of using secondary (health care) data in empirical research.
2. Execute the steps of a reproducible research project.
3. Be able to implement an empirical research project.
4. Recall the steps taken to execute a reproducible research project using secondary data.

## Structure of the study guide

The study guide consists of five chapters that include the essential steps of a reproducible research project. Each step is covered in three parts.
  
1. An introduction to the basics concepts and key terminology. 
2. A resources box that includes reference material on how to perform this step including main textbooks and references to current web resources with emphasise on open source materials.
3. A showcase example of a reproduced empirical project based on the article of *Hellerstein, Judith K. 1998. “The Importance of the Physician in the Generic versus Trade-Name Prescription Decision.” The RAND Journal of Economics 29 (1): 108–36. https://doi.org/10.2307/2555818*.
