\hypertarget{objective}{%
\section*{Objective}\label{objective}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Objective}

The objective of this study guide is to provide a resource to graduate
students, early career PhD candidates and researchers performing applied
empirical research in economics and management sciences. The pratical
application is in the field of analysis of health care markets using
secondary data. Many textbook examples use readily available data sets
for analysis of econometric problems. For students aiming to conduct
research by generating their own analysis data set, important steps that
lead to a final analysis data set are missing. Besides, many resources
focus on labour economics problems. Resources that consider processing
and generating secondary data are scarce. One reason is that often these
data sources are subject to confientiality and data protection issues
such these cannot be made available.

The objective of this study guide is to provide a resource that covers
the major steps of a reproducible research project in 5 steps. We will
introduce important terminology, highlight the relevant taks to be
performed, and to provide key resources in the form of text books and
websites available via open access. We aim to provide a concise guide
that user of this guide can easily access when starting academic
research. Each section is to be read within 10-15 minutes. For this
reason, we will not cover any specific data science or econometric
method, but point to the relevant resources. Therefore, users of this
guide should have knowledge in statistics and econometrics. Also, they
should have background knowledge on the subject matter they aim to
study.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Learning objectives}

The goal is to set up and carry out a data science project using
secondary data. Students will learn all steps starting with hypothesis
formulation, data generation and analysis, and presentation of empirical
results.

guide, you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Recognize the features of using secondary (health care) data in
  empirical research.
\item
  Execute the steps of a reproducible research project.

\chapter{Introduction to reproducible research}\label{intro}}

\emph{``Only results that can be replicated are truly scientific
results. If there is no chance to replicate research results, they can
be regarded as no more than personal views in the opinion or review
section of a daily newspaper.''} (Huschka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-huschka_why_2013}{2013})

\hypertarget{what-is-reproducible-research}{%
\section{What is reproducible
research?}\label{what-is-reproducible-research}}

Scientific journal editors and research funders are increasingly
promoting transparency in research. To encourage the principles of
reproducible research, the related institutions are requesting authors
to make their research reproducible. To overcome criticisms regarding
the validity and power of empirical tests, this means that data and
program code need to be shared upon manuscript acceptance, or earlier
stages of the submission process. The purpose is that third-parties have
the possibility to reproduce the content and analysis of a study, and
conclusions of a study on their own.

Efforts to increase reproducability have been expressed by multiple
institutions within the social sciences, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The best practices statement by the
  \href{https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/}{Social
  Science Data Editors},
\item
  In Germany, by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Consortium
  for the Social, Behavioural, Educational and Economic Sciences
  \href{https://www.ratswd.de/en/publikationen/output}{RatWSD}
\item
  In editorial statement of journals, for example American Economic
  Review, Management Science or the Journal of International Business
  Studies (Meyer, Witteloostuijn, and Beugelsdijk
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-meyer_whats_2017}{2017}; Orozco et al.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-orozco_how_2020}{2020})
\end{itemize}

Generally, \textbf{\emph{reproducibility}} of research can be defined as
``the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study
using the same materials and procedures as were used by the original
investigator. In an attempt to reproduce a published statistical
analysis, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the
same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis to
determine whether they yield the same results.'' (Bollen et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bollen_social_2015}{2015}). Study results are
considered reproducible if after an article publication another
researcher can conduct the analyses using identical data and obtain the
same results using the material provided.

Since empirical economic research is based on the application of a code
to a dataset to answer a pre-defined research question, ensuring the
reproducibility includes sharing the data and code to allow others to
re-analyze the data and to reproduce the reported results (Orozco et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-orozco_how_2020}{2020}). To achieve this, the
data and code need to be properly managed while working on a project.

Another concept closely related to \textbf{\emph{reproducibility}} is
the concept of \textbf{\emph{replicability}} that ``refers to the
ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the
same procedures are followed but new data are collected.'' (Bollen et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-bollen_social_2015}{2015}). Thus, for
example, if an investigator tries to replicate a scientific finding that
documents a relationship between two or more variables by using the same
scientific methodology but in a new setting, i.e.~with new data, and
fails and to reach a similar conclusion, i.e.~replicate it -- a failure
to replicate occurs. The opposite is said to be true if the results are
replicated. Thus, \textbf{\emph{reproducibility}} and
\textbf{\emph{replicability}} are considered to be the two main elements
of empirical research.

To adapt reproducible practices early on, undergraduate and graduate
students are encouraged to perform reproducible research in their term
papers, theses, and practical applications as soon as possbile. For this
reason, university teachers are increasingly asking to submit
reproduction material (source data information, data programming and
analysis code) at all stages of study.

The concept of reproducible research is not new and goes back as far as
the late 1800s (Vilhuber
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vilhuber_reproducibility_2020}{2020}). However,
reproducibility studies have disclosed that many rearchers do not follow
the principles of reproducible research. At the same time, the increase
in availability and use of public and especially non-public data
sources, and the increase in the reliance of research methods based on
specific software bringing the principles of reproducible research on
the agenda of many researchers.

The resources box in each chapter provides material of best practices in
data and code management to perform a reproducible research project, as
well as provides resources for best practices in cleaning the data and
conducting data analysis.

There is a number of threats to reproducible research process that can
undermine scientific research or lead to false or biased conclusions and
publications, see, e.g.~@ref(fig:munafo) illustrating main threats to
reproducible science (Munafò et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-munafo_manifesto_2017}{2017}).

Following the reproducible research principles allows you to be a part
of a good academic practice that strives to improve the quality,
efficiency and reliability of scientific research.

\hypertarget{main-steps-to-produce-reproducible-research}{%
\section{Main steps to produce reproducible
research}\label{main-steps-to-produce-reproducible-research}}

To follow the best practices of reproducible research, you will need to
consider \textbf{\emph{how}} to perform your project and the
\textbf{\emph{steps a reproducible research project}} contains.

There are three main principles to enhance reproducible research (Orozco
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-orozco_how_2020}{2020}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Organize your work:}} consider and plan your steps at
  the beginning of the project
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Code for others:}} set up each step of your project such
  that an outsider could follow your documentation
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Automate as much as you can:}} avoid processing analyses
  and results using point-and-click softare (MS Excel), export results
  directly and create a reproducible project documentation.
\end{enumerate}

In this study guide we follow the main steps of performing a
reproducible data science project (Bezjak et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bezjak_open_2018}{2018}). To make your empirical
research study process reproducible, you need to follow these five steps
(Figure @ref(fig:reproducible)):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  \textbf{\emph{Formulating a hypothesis}} (Section @ref(hypothesis))

\hypertarget{secondary-health-care-data}{%
\section{Secondary (health care)
data}\label{secondary-health-care-data}}

This study guide concentrates on empirical investigation using secondary
data, that means data that is not originally collected or generated by
the researcher for the purpose of the study. Secondary data covers any
existing data generated by companies, institutions, and individuals.

Examples of secondary data sources are routinelly collected health data
(administrative claims, electronic medical records), bibliometric data,
survey data, regulatory data, data generated in mobile applications.

\hypertarget{creating-an-environment-for-productive-research-projects}{%
\section{Creating an environment for productive research
projects}\label{creating-an-environment-for-productive-research-projects}}

Before you start running the study you should assess your available
resources, that means time and own expertise to see whether the study
design is feasible. If there is an opportunity to work collaboratively
and you think that the project can benefit from the expertise of another
researcher, you can approach the person and ask whether they would be
interested to work together on the project. Joining resources might
relax your resource availability contraints. It may further ensure that
you engage in a reproducible research process.

\hypertarget{basic-steps-to-formulate-a-hypothesis}{%
\section{Basic steps to formulate a
hypothesis}\label{basic-steps-to-formulate-a-hypothesis}}

You decided to undertake a scientific project. Where do you start?
First, you need to find a research question that interests you and
formulate a hypothesis. We will introduce some key terminology, steps
you can undertake and examples how to develop research questions. Note
that there is no single best way to develop a research idea (Pischke
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pischke_how_2012}{2012}).

\emph{What if someone assigns a topic to me? For students attending
undergraduate and graduate courses that often pick topics from a list,
all of these steps are equally important and necessary. You still need
to formulate a research question and a hypothesis. And it is important
to clarify the relevance of your topic for yourself.}

\hypertarget{what-is-a-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{What is a hypothesis?}\label{what-is-a-hypothesis}}

A hypothesis is a statement that introduces your research question and
suggests the results you might find in your research. You will test your
hypothesis with your empirical analysis. Thus, hypothesis constitutes
the main basis of your scientific investigation. You should be careful
when creating it.

A hypothesis is an educated guess. You start by posing an economic
question and formulate a hypothesis about this question. Then you test
it with your data and analyses and either accept or reject the
hypothesis.

\hypertarget{how-do-you-develop-a-research-question-and-formulate-a-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{How do you develop a research question and formulate a
hypothesis?}\label{how-do-you-develop-a-research-question-and-formulate-a-hypothesis}}

When thinking about a research question (Trochim
\protect\hyperlink{ref-trochim_problem_nodate}{n.d.}), you need to
identify a topic that is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Relevant}, important in the world and interesting to you as
  researcher: Does working on the topic excites you? You will spend many
  hours working on it. Therefore, it should be interesting and engaging
  enough for you to motivate your continued work on this topic.
\item
  \emph{Specific}: not too broad and not too narrow
\item
  \emph{Feasible} to research within a given timeframe: Is it possible
  to answer the research question based on your time budget, data and
  additional resources.
\end{itemize}

How do you find a topic or develop a feasible research idea in the first
place? Finding an idea is not difficult, the critical part is to find a
\textbf{good} idea. How do you do that? There is no one specific way how
one gets an idea, rather there is a myriad of ways how people come up
with potential ideas (Varian
\protect\hyperlink{ref-varian_how_2016}{2016}). Once you decide on an
idea, run it by a few people. That means approach your supervisor and
other fellow students to see whether it is interesting enough to pursue
it.

For example, you can find inspiration by

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Looking at insights from the world around you: your own life and
  experiences, observe the behavior of people around you
\item
  Talking to people around you, experts, other students, family members
\item
  Talking to individuals outside your field (non-economists)
\item
  Talking to professionals working in the area you are investigating
  (you may use social media and professional platforms like LinkedIN or
  Twitter to make contact)
\item
  Reading journal articles from other non-economic social sciences and
  the medical literature
\item
  Reading economic and non-economic newspaper and magazine articles
  (e.g.~Süddeutsche, Frankfurter Allgemeine, Tagesspiegel, The
  Economist, the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian),
  watching TV programs

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What are the issues being discussed?
  \item
    How do these issues affect people's lives?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

You could in addition

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to virtual and in-person seminars, for example the
  \href{https://www.goek.wiwi.uni-due.de/forschung/essen-health-economics-seminar/winter-2020-21/}{Essen
  Health Economics Seminar}
\item
  Look at abstracts of scientific articles and working papers
\item
  Look at the literature in a specific field you are interested in, for
  example sceening complete issues of journals or editorials about
  certain research advancements. By reading this literature you might
  come up with the idea on how to extend and refine previous research.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{develop-a-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{Develop a Hypothesis}\label{develop-a-hypothesis}}

Before you formulate your hypothesis, read up on the topic of interest.
This reading should provide you with sufficient information to narrow
down your research question. The research question comes from the topic
you are contemplating. Once you find your question you need to develop a
hypothesis. A hypothesis is your research question distilled into a one
sentence statement. It presents a statement of your expectations
regarding your research question's results. You propose to prove your
hypothesis with your research by testing the relationship between two
variables of interest. Thus, a hypothesis should be testable with the
data at hand. There are two types of hypotheses: alternative or null.
Null states that there is no effect. Alternative states that there is an
effect.

It should be noted that there is an alternative view on this that
suggests one should not look at the literature too early on in the
idea-generating process in order not to be influenced and shaped by
someone else's ideas. According to this view you can spend some time
(i.e.~a few weeks) trying to develop your own original idea. Even if you
end up with an idea that has already been pursued by someone else, this
will still provide you with good practice in developing publishable
ideas. After you have developed an idea and made sure that it was not
yet investigated in the literature, you can start conducting a
systematic literature review. By doing this, you can find some other
interesting insights from the work of others that you can synthesize in
your own work to produce something novel and original.

\hypertarget{identify-relevant-literature}{%
\subsection{Identify Relevant
Literature}\label{identify-relevant-literature}}

For your research project you will need to identify and collect previous
relevant literature. It should involve a thorough search of the keywords
in relevant databases and journals. Place emphasis on articles from
high-ranking journals with significant numbers of citations. This will
give you an indication of the most influential and important work in the
field. Once you identify and collect the relevant literature for your
topic, you will need to \textbf{critically} synthesize it in your
literature review.

When you perform your literature review, consider theories that may
inform your research question. For example when studying physician
behavior, you may consider approaches made using principal-agency
theory.

\subsection{Research question or literature review, a hen and egg
problem?}\label{research-question-or-literature-review-a-hen-and-egg-problem}}

Whether you start reading the literature first or by developing an idea
may depend on your stage (graduate student, early career researcher) and
other goals. However, thinking freely about what you like to investigate
first may help to critically develop a feasible and interesting research
question.

We highlight an example how to start with investigating the real-world
and subsequently posing a research question (``How to Write a Strong
Hypothesis Steps and Examples''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-noauthor_how_2019}{2019}; ``Developing Strong
Research Questions Criteria and Examples''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-noauthor_developing_2019}{2019}; Schilbach
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schilbach_5_2019}{2019}). For example, based on
your own observation you notice that people seem to spend extensive
amount of time looking at their smartphones. Maybe even you yourself
engage in the same behavior. In addition, you read a BBC News article
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55826238}{Social media damages
teenagers' mental health, report says}.

\textbackslash begin\{figure\}

\{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{C:/Users/KFischer/sciebo/Date Literacy Project/06 Manuscript/bookdown/DataLiteracy/_book/DataLiteracy_files/figure-html/Social-media}

\}

\textbackslash caption\{social\_media\}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}
\textbackslash end\{figure\}

Source: \href{https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55826238}{BBC}

You decided to translate this article and your observations into a
research question. A \textbf{research question} could be: \emph{How does
daily social media use influence our mental health?} Before you
formulate your hypothesis, read up on the topic of interest. This
reading should provide you with sufficient information to narrow down
your research question. Read economic, medical and other social science
literature on the topic. There is likely to be a vast amount of non-econ
literature from non-econ fields that are doing research on your topic of
interest, for example psychology or neuroscience. Familiarize yourself
with it and master it. Do not get distracted by different scientific
methodologies and techniques that might seem not up-to-par to the
economic studies (small sample sizes, endogeneity, uncovering
association rather than causation, etc.), but rather focus on
suggestions of potential mechanisms.

A hypothesis is then your research question distilled into a one
sentence statement. It presents a statement of your expectations
regarding your research question's results. You propose to prove your
hypothesis with your research by testing the relationship between two
variables of interest. Thus, a hypothesis should be testable with the
data at hand. There are two types of hypotheses: alternative or null.
The \textbf{null}* hypothesis states that there is no effect. The
\textbf{alternative} hypothesis states that there is an effect.

A hypothesis related to the above-stated research question could be:
\emph{The increased use of social media among teenagers leads to (is
associated with) worse mental health outcomes, i.e.~increased incidence
of depression, worse well-being and lower self-esteem.} Your hypothesis
suggests a direction of a relationship that you expect to find. It is
not a blind guess, but is guided by your observations and existing
evidence, that means the reports that you have collected. It is testable
with scientific research methods, that means by using statistical
analysis of the relevant data.

Your hypothesis suggests a relationship between two variables: social
media use (your independent variable \(X\)) and mental health (dependent
variable \(Y\)). Note, that this hypothesis could be framed in terms of
correlation (is associated with) or causation (leads to). This should be
reflected in the choice of scientific investigation you decide to
undertake.

The \textbf{null} hypothesis is: \emph{There is no relationship between
social media use among teenagers and their mental health}.

It should be noted that there is an alternative view on this idea - a
hypothesis-generating process that suggests that one should not look at
the literature too early on in the idea-generating process not to be
influenced and shaped by someone else's ideas. According to this view
you can spend some time like a few weeks trying to develop your own
original idea. Even if you end up with an idea that has already been
pursued by someone else and published, this will still provide you with
good practice in developing publishable ideas. After you have developed
an idea and made sure that it was not yet investigated in the
literature, you can start conducting a systematic literature review. By
doing this, you can find some other interesting insights from the work
of others that you can synthesize in your own work to produce something
novel and original.

As an illustration of the research process of formulating a hypothesis,
designing the study, running the study and collecting the data,
analysing the data and, finally, reporting the study, we provide an
example of the partly reproduction of a highly cited paper in the field
of health economics . At the end of each chapter, we demonstrate insides
into the study ``The importance of the Physician in the Generic versus
Trade-Name Prescription Decision'' by Judith K. Hellerstein from the
year 1998 (Hellerstein
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hellerstein_importance_1998}{1998}) that we
reproduced.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Relevance of the topic - escalating

Worldwide, health systems face constantly increasing prescription drug
expenditures. In the United States, the total prescription drug
expenditure in 2020 marked about 358.7 billion US-Dollars (Statista
\protect\hyperlink{ref-statista_prescription_2020}{2020}). The
prescription of generic drugs is an option in reducing the total health
care expenditure. Generic drugs are bioequivalent in the active
ingredients but have discounts of up to 80 percent compared to the
trade-name alternative (Pruckner and Schober
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pruckner_hospitals_2018}{2018}).

\hypertarget{development-of-a-research-question---identifying-the-role-of-physician-practice-in-choosing-generic-drugs}{%

drugs}}{Development of a research question - identifying the role of physician practice in choosing generic drugs}}\label{development-of-a-research-question---identifying-the-role-of-physician-practice-in-choosing-generic-drugs}}

Physicians are faced with a multitude of different medication options,
including generic and trade-name drugs. Physicians ideally act as agents
for their patients to identify the best available treatment option.
However, choosing the best treatment entails cost of coordination and
cognition. The prescription of generic drugs may serve as an example to
what extent physicians customize treatments according to patient's needs
with regards to cost. From an economic point of view one might suggest
that once a generic drug is available, a perfectly rational consumer
would demand a generic drug instead of the trade-name version (Fischer
and Stargardt \protect\hyperlink{ref-fischer_diffusion_2016}{2016}).
This asks for the research question, whether \emph{``physicians vary
their prescription decisions on a patient-by-patient basis or whether
they systematically prescribe the same version, trade-name or generic,
to all patients''}. The aim of this study is to identify the role the
physician plays in prescribing a generic over a trade-name drug and the
role of a patient's insurance status.

\hypertarget{hypothesis---insurance-status-drives-generic-drug-use}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Hypothesis - insurance status drives
generic drug
use}}{Hypothesis - insurance status drives generic drug use}}\label{hypothesis---insurance-status-drives-generic-drug-use}}

To empirically analyse the research question, one needs to make use of
different groups to draw conclusions. Hellerstein (1998) considers a
patient's insurance status as a matter of dividing the study population
in groups. The hypothesis to test the underlying research question can
be formulated as \emph{``Physicians are more likely to prescribe
generics to patients who do not have insurance coverage for prescription
pharmaceuticals''} (Hellerstein
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hellerstein_importance_1998}{1998}). So a
relationship between the two variables, prescription of a generic drug
(dependent variable) and insurance status (independent variable) of the
patient is suggested.

\hypertarget{basic-steps-in-designing-your-study}{%
\section{Basic steps in designing your
study}\label{basic-steps-in-designing-your-study}}

We have arrived at the heart of your research study to specify how you
will empirically test your hypothesis. We focus on study designs make
use of secondary data with the aim to identify the magnitude of effects
of causal relationships between a variable of interest \(X\) and a
certain outcome \(Y\). Note that there is extensive literature and
guidance to perform causal inference, some of which we guide you to
below. We will highlight the most important elements and point to the
relevant resources.

You have chosen your research questions and formulated a hypothesis. You
also have collected and reviewed all the relevant literature on your
topic. Now, you need to decide on your research design. Are you planning
to uncover associations, or do you want to examine a causal relationship
between your variables of interest (Pearl
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl_causality_2009}{2009}; Pearl, Glymour, and
Jewell \protect\hyperlink{ref-pearl_causal_2016}{2016})? To translate
direct observations in data to investigate cause-and-effect
relationships, you will need to rely on a workable model that describes
the elements reflected by your hypothesis. For that reason, it is
recommended that you first describe the causal structures of the
elements that you are studying, including any other observed or
unobserved structures that may disturb the cause-and-effect relationship
under investigation.

The design of your study will depend on the causal model that suggests
which effects are estimable, given that there are suitable data to
empirically identify the effect. Consider that you describe
cause-and-effect relationship first, assess how it is estimable (that
means that you ask the question ``Can you infer a causal effect from
your data?'') and then investigate the effect by direct observations
using secondary data. The alternative is to start out with a regression
estimated effect and then investigate whether it has a causal
interpretation.

Consider the subsequent steps as an iterative process, allowing that not
all data you may need to estimate effects of your causal model will be
readily available. Some elements will remain unobserved.

\hypertarget{develop-a-causal-model-and-identify-estimable-effects}{%
\subsection{Develop a causal model and identify estimable
effects}\label{develop-a-causal-model-and-identify-estimable-effects}}

Once you have made this decision, you should specify a causal model that
describes the relationships between the elements that you are studying.
This causal model will help to identify empirical model by defining your
main relationship of interest.

You need to specify your

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  main outcomes variable of interest (\(X\))
\item
  main independent variable of interest (\(Y\))
\item
  other independent variables (confounders of the effect of \(X\) on
  \(Y\)), that means any additional \(Z\)'s
\item
  unobserved variables (\(U\))
\end{itemize}

For better visualization, you may plot the corresponding
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-dags.html}{directed
acyclic graph} to describe the relationships between your variable of
interest and any confounding variable. It is recommended to do this step
before data collection. That way, you avoid collection of data that may
not be needed. You also avoid forgetting variables that are necessary to
for causal effect identification. And you may
\href{https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf}{check for so-called
bad controls} that may bias your estimates.

Potential outcomes framework notation

Write down your estimate, your estimand, notation

After you have specified your causal model, ask yourself how you can
capture the causal relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\). In other words,
can you apply an appropriate research design that can accommodate you in
determining causality with the data at hand? Following the
classification by Matthay et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-matthay_alternative_2020}{2020}), that means by
performing a

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT): this would be the ideal world case
  where we could randomize treatments to study effect
\end{itemize}

Secondary data will not allow performing a RCT as you will not be able
to randomly assign subjects, such that you need to run a
quasi-experiment to identify treatment effects using a

\end{itemize}

Think about what type of treatment effect you are investigating in your
causal analysis. The treatment effect is the average (across the
population or across some subpopulation) of the change in outcome
(\(Y\)) that results from a change in a covariate (the treatment \(X\))
(Lewbel \protect\hyperlink{ref-lewbel_identification_2019}{2019}).

Common types of treatment effect parameters are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  average treatment effects (ATE)
\item
  average treatment effects on the treated (ATT)
\item
  marginal treatment effects (MTE)
\item

\item
  quantile treatment effects (QTE)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{investigate-suitable-source-data}{%
\subsection{Investigate suitable source
data}\label{investigate-suitable-source-data}}

You need to find and collect suitable data to populate your causal
model. This might take some time, and not all of the variables can be
found in one dataset. You might frequently need to collect and combine a
few different data sources. When searching for the data sources, you can
turn to already existing datasets specifically designed for scientific
use, for example surveys (NAMCS, CPS, NLSY, HILDA, RLMS HSE, KiGGS);
panels (for example GSOEP, SHARE, HRS, ELSA); censuses
(e.g.~Microcensus). {[}INCLUDE LINKS{]}

Some data are available from statistical offices (Eurostat in the
European Union, DESTATIS for Germany), private companies (health
insurances), Social Media and App based data (Mappiness, Fitbit,
Facebook, Twitter, WayBetter) or governmental and non-governmental
institutions (EMA, FDA, BfARM). Sometimes you have to hand-collect and
digitize the necessary data, for example from historical documents, data
from governmental and non-governmental agencies, commercial providers
and library search engines, archives; download statistical tables from
INKAR's or Unemployment Agency's websites. Therefore, you need to plan
whether and how these can be accessed and how much time is needed for
extraction. Consider automated tools like scraping.

You need to decide on what aggregation level you need to conduct your
analysis to estimate the cause-and-effect relationships postulated, for
example individual (patient, student), organization (hopstial), regional
(country, state). Given that, you need to identify appropriate data
sources that contain your variables of interest at the given aggregation
level.

\section{Example: Hellerstein (1998)}\label{example-hellerstein-1998-1}}

With the identified research question and the hypothesis that physicians
are more likely to prescribe generics to patients who do not have
insurance coverage for prescription pharmaceuticals at hand an
observational, retrospective analysis of secondary data, including
patient and physician characteristics is needed. The goal of the
analysis is to identify a causal effect of the patient's insurance
status (independent variable \(X\)) on the prescription of a generic
over a trade-name drug (dependent variable, \(Y\)). As the prescription
decision of the physician is prone to involve information imperfections
and agency problems, the empirical model needs to control for physician
specific effects among other possible influencing factors.

The confounder control study design chosen by Hellerstein (1998) applies
a random effects probit specification at physician level. This includes
the variable of interest (estimate), a binary variable, which indicates
whether a patient got a trade-name or a generic drug prescribed. The
estimate takes the value 1 if a generic drug or the value 0 if a
trade-name drug was prescribed. Of interest is the causal effect of the
patients different insurance types. Those include Medicare, Medicaid,
HMO/prepaid and private insurance. Other independent variables included
in the analysis for the purpose of reducing possible bias are the drug
class, patient characteristics (age, gender, race), if the physician is
a specialist, the region and the averages of patient characteristics per
physician. The choice of covariates to be included in a study depends on
the study design, the relevant literature in the field and on possible
restriction by the underlying data. Sometimes a certain creativity is
needed, to use the data at hand in such way to be able to account for
possible bias. An example from Hellerstein's (1998) study design is the
explicit need to include prices into the empirical analysis. Though
prices are not given in the data used, they were accounted for by
including drug class dummy variables assuming that prices vary across
different drug classes. This way, though we cannot identify the effect
of the individual prices directly, we account for possible bias of the
different prices of drug classes.

\section{Basic steps when running the study and collecting the
data}\label{basic-steps-when-running-the-study-and-collecting-the-data}}

In this step it is about to specify which data to use and collect the
data. As this study guide focuses on secondary data, you will need to
identify relevant data sources, obtain the source data and process the
data. As many data sources are not primarily developed for the
particular purpose of your study, you often will need to modify the
source data to reflect the measurements of your \(Y's,X's\) and \(Z's\)
you wish to examine in your causal model. It is also often that
secondary data is not readily available for analysis such that you will
need to collect and process these data (for example by writing program
that extracts data from a website, search engine, or API, or by applying
for permission to access the data).

We will distinguish between \textbf{source data set(s)} and the
\textbf{analysis data set} that you will be using to run the study.

We point to the following distinction that will have implications on the
resources needed to collect and process:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Secondary source data that is readily available and has been
  documented earlier (for example panels)
\item
  Secondary source data that you will need to process for the purpose of
  your study (for example by use of web-scraping, use of web-APIs, or
  extraction from data warehouses)
\end{itemize}

The following steps are typically performed when collecting the data:

\hypertarget{identify-secondary-data-sources}{%
\subsection{Identify secondary data
sources}\label{identify-secondary-data-sources}}

Once you have designed the study, you can now search for appropriate
data sources of your \(X's\), \(Y's\) and \(Z's\). That means you
investigate which data items of one or multiple secondary data source(s)
you are using and how these items can be collected. It is part of this
process that you document where, how and which data you gathered and
processed. A codebook that includes a description of the content of the
data source is such a piece of documentation. Specify exactly the
variables that you will be extracting and any exclusions of the data
source. If you are generating a dataset yourself from another source
through scraping techniques, you equally need to document how the data
are collected and processed, for example by sharing the corresponding
script and a description of that data.

You need to assess the suitability of the potential secondary data
sources. Types and use of secondary data sources has been described
across different disciplines, for example Hair, Page, and Brunsveld
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hair_nature_2019}{2019}) for business data,

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fitchett_quantitative_2017}{2017}) for social
studies. It is important to assess the quality of the secondary data
sources by criteria like the following (Hair, Page, and Brunsveld
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hair_nature_2019}{2019}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{measurement validity}: this may be difficult to assess, but
  you may want to look out for research that has used the data you aim
  to use as well
\item
  \textbf{reliability}: is the source that you are using providing the
  data at sufficient quality (see more in Hair)
\item
  \textbf{potential bias} arises when the data do not measure what you
  want to measure. Biases may arise from for example, changes in the
  sample from which the data is collected (for example if an institution
  changes the way data are reported, if the sampled population is
  changing)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use a data schema to describe how you combine different secondary data
  sets into your analysis data set.
\item
  Even if there is only one source data set that you are using, you may
  need to think about how this data set needs to be processed to be fit
  for your final analysis purpose.
\item
  Pay attention to how different data sources are linked, that means are
  there unique identifiers of the invidual subjects that you are
  studying (for example identifiers for patients, physicians, firms,
  products). Are they equal across the different source data?
\item
  Per each data set, describe which variables or items you plan to
  collect and how you aim to process the source data to fit the purpose
  of your study.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Investigate how you can obtain access to the data including
  permissions, fees and any ethical considerations.
\item
  Note that many data sources require registration and/or charge fees
  for obtaining access and processing requests. Special conditions for
  academics and students often apply. You may need to describe your
  research project and ask for permission. Allow these steps to take
  considerable time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process and prepare the source
data}\label{process-and-prepare-the-source-data}}

Once the source data has arrived, been extracted or simply you hit the
download button, at this stage you need to develop a program (Stata
do-file, R-code or code using other software) that documents the data
extraction steps and that leads to an analysis data set. Make sure you
save all raw source data in a safe place that in terms of data
protection. Ensure, that you do not accidentally delete or overwrite
these data.

When you develop the program, you will need to make decisions informed
by the previous steps related to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Combining, merging, appending datasets
\item
  Specifying datasets and variables needed to estimate your regression
  model

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Which variables are included/excluded?
  \item
    Which variables need to be modified (recoded/calculated)? How?
  \item
    Creating new variables
  \item
    Labeling the variables
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Defining the study period
\item
  Defining exclusion criteria (for example teens or adults only, general
  practicioners or physicinas)
\item
  Aggregating to the appropriate level (individual, family, county,
  state, country, patient, physician, or hospital, etc.)
\item
  Specifying the final analysis data set: what outcomes (\(Y\)),
  variables of interest (\(X\)), confounders (other \(X\)'s),
  instruments (\(Z\)) are possible to use from the data?

\hypertarget{example-hellerstein-1998-2}{%
\section{Example: Hellerstein (1998)}\label{example-hellerstein-1998-2}}

The empirical application of Hellerstein (1998) is based on three
datasets from the year 1989. As the confidential data is key to
identifying physicians and patients we, for the purpose of this example,
resort to the 1991 data, that provides these identifiers in two publicly
available datasets. The two available datasets are called NAMCS and
NAMCSd. The former contains demographic and medical information on the
full sample of patients and is mainly used to introduce the analysis
population. NAMCSd dataset contains information on medications, that
were mentioned, prescribed or given to a subsample of patients of the
NAMCS data.

The publically available data can be downloaded at the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd}{Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)}. The data come in an .exe format. We use the unpacking
software 7-zip to convert the files in a .txt format. It usually is the
case, that you need to perform certain transformations to the raw
dataset. This can apply to the file or data format, the structure of the
dataset or you might need to combine different datasets. The raw data we
downloaded from the CDC are a good example for that. When importing the
text file into Stata, all data lies in one string in the first column,
meaning that we do not have different variables for the individual
information (i.e.~patient characteristics). To be able to use the data,
we need to manually split the string into the wanted format, so every
information in a separate variable. Which digits in the initial string
belong to which variable is elaborated in the documentation files (also
often referred to as code book) that also can be found on the CDC
website. Almost every dataset comes with a codebook, containing useful
information on the coding or handling of the data at hand. This can
often help and provide the necessary information needed to successfully
prepare your data for empirical analysis.

The preparation of your data can be done with different software for
statistical analysis, for the reproduction of our Hellerstein (1998)
example we use Stata, creating a .do -file containing the code. It is of
importance to develop a file of your code, containing every step you
performed with your data. This ensures the reproducibility of your
research and enables you to go back to earlier versions of your data if
necessary. After downloading the NAMCS and NAMCSd we performed the
following cleaning (i.e.~exclusion of certain observations),
transforming and preparation steps, that are needed to reproduce the
tables and figures originally produced by Hellerstein (1998):

For NAMCS, used for the reproduction of table 1:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Observations of patients, who were not charged, were dropped.
\item
  Missing data must be relabeled according to the syntax of the
  statistic software and observations with missing data were not
  considered.
\item
  The setup of the dummy variables for Medicare and Specialists underlie
  special conditions (details can be found in the do-file attached),
  whereas the remaining dummies were not created straight away.
\end{itemize}

For NAMCSd, used for all other figures and tables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Keeping only those observations of drugs that are the first mentioned
  drug in a patient visit.
\item
  Keeping only those observations of drug mentions, that are part of the
  eight largest drug classes. The names of the included drug classes can
  be found in table 3 and the labels the data uses in the documentation
  files.
\item
  Keeping only those observations of drugs, that were prescribed.
\item
  Create the same dummies as in the preparation of the NAMCS data
  (footnote table 2)
\item
  Create an indicator on whether a drug is a multisource drug
  (definition given in ch.1 paragr. 1: ``We categorized drugs with the
  same ingredients and define drugs in an ingredient-group as
  multisource if there is at least one generic and one tradename drug
  within a group.'').
\item
  Dropping observations of medications that are not multisource drugs.
\item
  Using the variable on whether a drug is a generic or trade-name drug
  to create an indicator on whether the drug is a generic (dependable
  variable).
\item
  Creating physician averages of variables listed on p.~123 of
  Hellerstein (1998).
\end{itemize}

After these steps are taken, the dataset is ready for statistical
analysis (see at the end of the next chapter). Of importance is to
ensure that the raw data, the data preparation .do -file and the
analysis dataset are stored safely.

\hypertarget{analyzing}{%
\chapter{Analyzing the Data}\label{analyzing}}

\hypertarget{basic-steps-when-analyzing-the-data}{%
\section{Basic steps when analyzing the
data}\label{basic-steps-when-analyzing-the-data}}

Think again about your research question and what you are trying to
learn or discover. How can you use your data to answer this question?

The data to be analyzed should correspond to the core elements of the
hypothesis to be investigated. You investigate whether the postulated
cause-effect relationship exists, or quantitatively identify the
strength of the effect. To perform a reproducible research project, you
will need to create a set of programs that describes how the secondary
data used was synthesized, process and analysed. To document all steps
of your analysis, you should use programs like Stata or R.

Across all steps, try to use data visualization using tables and
diagrams. These are an essential part of your work and not an accessory.
Visualizations help to support the argumentation in the text and
visualize complex facts in a simple form. In the following, we describe
the three major tasks for data analysis

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Generate the analysis data set
\item
  Describe your data, assess validity and plausiblity
\item
  Generate estimates of your investigated effect using regression
  techniques
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{generate-the-analysis-data-set}{%
\subsection{Generate the analysis data
set}\label{generate-the-analysis-data-set}}

There are three major tasks that are typically needed to generate the
analysis data set:

\textbf{1. Clean your data.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  get/collect the data and transfer them in a format you use, for
  example to .dta from .xlsx (if neccessary)
\item
  Make sure that you link different data sets correctly using correct
  identifiers.
\item
  Take time to look through the data, check them, and delete anything
  that looks suspicious.
\item
  Select your sample of interest.
\item
  Generate and leave only variables necessary for your anaylsis.
\item
  Ensure that you make plausible and relevant exclusion decisions, for
  example regarding the time period studied, products, health
  conditions, age groups.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Structuring and aggregating of the analysis data}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Only include variables of your empirical model to be included to the
  analysis data set!
\item
  Aggregate your data to the level of analysis. For example, if you aim
  to analyse physician behavior over time, there should be one
  observation for each time period and physician (panel data). If your
  data is purely cross-sectional, there should not be multiple time
  periods in your data. That means in a cross-section of physicians, one
  row represents one physician.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Store your data}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your analysis data set is the most important piece for your analyis.
\item
  Physically store the version of your analysis data set that you are
  using.
\item
  Use version control if you are modifying your analysis data set.
\item
  Ensure that the code to create your analysis data set is complete and
  can reproduce the analysis data set completely.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{describe-your-data-assess-validity-and-plausiblity}{%
\subsection{Describe your data, assess validity and
plausiblity}\label{describe-your-data-assess-validity-and-plausiblity}}

Start the data analysis by doing some descriptive analyses of your data
and sample. Once you have selected the necessary variables, generated
new variables for the analysis, and combined all the necessary datasets
into one analysis dataset you can start your empirical investigation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Check the plausibility by looking at basic descriptives (N, mean,
  median, frequencies)
\item
  Plot the distribution of your data using histograms, boxplots, bar
  charts
\item
  Critically reflect any anormalities: Compare your data with the
  reference literature
\item
  Are descriptives similar? If not, why so? Try to assess coding
  problems, different population, unbalanced samples.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{generate-estimates-of-your-investigated-effect-using-regression-techniques}{%
\subsection{Generate estimates of your investigated effect using
regression
techniques}\label{generate-estimates-of-your-investigated-effect-using-regression-techniques}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Once you have decided on the type of empirical analyses you would like
  to perform, run the regressions.
\item
  Perform the regression analyses, that means by using the appropriate
  procedure to estimate regressions that reflect your empirical
  strategy.
\item
  Create output tables that report your results which outsiders can
  understand, for example label your variables properly
\item
  Concentrate on analyzing and interpreting the effects of your variable
  of interest (\(X\))

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    interpret and show in tables ony most important and relevant
    coefficients related to the research question. For example, you do
    not need to interpret and display coefficients for all of the
    incuded control variables, just the main variables of interest.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Think about how to interpret your estimates.
\item
  Challenge your approach. Investigate why your estimates could not be
  plausible?
\item
  Again, compare with existing literature.
\item
  What does your data say? After you run the regressions, look at the
  results:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Are your main coefficients of interest statistically significant,
    that means is the p-value smaller than 0.05 or any other pre-defined
    level of significance?
  \item
    Consider also the economic significance of your results. Is the
    effect you are measuring large or small?
  \item
    Do your results make sense or are they counterintuitive? This might
    give you a clue that you might have misspecified your regression or
    made a mistake in your analysis.

\section{Example: Hellerstein (1998)}\label{example-hellerstein-1998-3}}

Hellerstein's (1998) study aims to answer the research question if
physicians vary their prescription decisions on a patient-by-patient
basis or whether they systematically prescribe the same version of a
drug, trade-name or generic, to all patients. This means that the
secondary data of the CDC (NAMCS and NAMCSd) will be analysed on
physician level in a cross-sectional format. This, as we are not looking
at the prescription behaviour over time (panel data) but rather if the
physicians do or do not prescribe a generic drug. Over the course of
your analysis, you want to explore your dataset, this includes
describing and assessing the validity and plausibility. Thus before
generating estimates of your investigated effect using regression
techniques, you want to describe your data with descriptive statistics
tables and, if applicable, figures. We first reproduce the descriptive
statistics of Hellerstein (1998), namely table 1-3 and figure 1-2.
Details of created variables can be found in the data preparation
.do-file and the notes of the tables and figures in Hellerstein's (1998)
paper. Please keep in mind that we used the data of 1991, thus our
numbers are not matching with the original paper.

In the following we explain the steps taken to reproduce table 1-3 and
figure 1-2, as well as the reproduction of the empirical analysis.
Details and the code can be found in the Appendix and at the end of the
next chapter when reporting the study results.

\hypertarget{describe-your-data-assess-validity-and-plausiblity-1}{%

\textbf{Table 1:} Compute the mean and summary statistics for the age
and the previously established dummies in the NAMCS data.

\textbf{Table 2:} For the first two columns, repeat the procedure of
table 1 using the NAMCSd data. For the third column, compute the mean of
the generic indicator for all subpopulations defined by the dummies.

\textbf{Table 3:} Using summary statistics command, count the number of
observations for the full sample and for each of the eight defined drug
classes. Further, compute the mean of the generic indicator in the full
sample and each drug class subsample.

\textbf{Figure 1:} For each physician, compute the mean of the generic
indicator and drop duplicate observations per physician. This way every
physician has a unique observation with a respective share of generic
prescriptions. To approximate the distribution shown in figure 1, some
specifications are not elaborated sufficiently, so we assumed by visual
approximation. The assumed specifications are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On what decimal place the generic means were rounded (we chose
  \(.01\))
\item
  The bandwidth (we chose \(0.02\))
\item
  The kernel function (we chose a bilinear form)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Figure 2:} Keep physicians that prescribe the same multisource
drug to at least six patients, so either in its generic or tradename
form. Compute the mean of the generic indicator for each remaining
physician and create a dummy variable on whether this mean is zero
(i.e.~only trade names), one (i.e.~only generics), or something in
between (i.e.~both versions). These three dummies are then plotted in a
bar plot.

\subsection{Generate estimates of your investigated effect using
regression

Hellerstein applies a random effects probit regression model aggregated
on physician level. The parameterization of the model is implemented as
follows:

\textbf{Dependent variable \(Y\)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  G \emph{Generic status}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Independent variables \(X\)}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \(X\): \emph{Age, female, Hispanic nonwhite}
\item

  (Self-paid omitted)}
\item
  \(S\): \emph{Specialist}
\item
  \(R\): \emph{Midwest, South, West (Northeast omitted)}
\item
  vector \(X\), vector \(P\): \emph{Averages across physician}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Table 4 and 5:}

Estimate the regression coefficients, t-statistics and marginal effects
of the regression model. It is not specified whether the model for both
tables contain all covariates specified in equation 10 or just the
variables mentioned in the tables. We decided to use the full model for
both tables. Marginal effects are the average marginal effects (AME)
across individuals (footnote table 4).

\textbf{Table 6:} Run a separate regression using only observations of a

By reporting your study you provide readers with the information
necessary for them to assess the contribution of your study and the
soundness of methods used, allows them to reproduce the study if they
wish, and decide whether they agree with the conclusions that you draw
given your data, methods, and results. Thus, from the instructions from
your paper a reader should understand and be able to reproduce every
table and figure.

A research paper usually includes the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Title
\item
  Abstract
\item
  Introduction
\item
  Previous Literature Review
\item
  Data and Variables
\item
  Empirical Methods
\item
  Results
\item
  Discussion
\item
  Summary and Conclusion
\item
  References
\item
  Appendices
\end{itemize}

We will briefly summarize each of these items.

The \textbf{Title} should be short (15 words or less) and reflect your
research question. It needs to reflect the purpose (what is the question
that you are addressing?), scope (i.e.~if you cover a specific time
period or population) of the study. Sometimes you might want to include
the methods of your study in the title, if, e.g.~you conduct a cohort
study. All this information should help the reader to decide whether or
not they are interested in reading it.

The \textbf{Abstract} is usually around 300 words and includes a very
short summary of your research question, data and methods used, main
findings, and conclusions.

The \textbf{Introduction} should be part of the paper that is written at
the very end. It should motivate your research topic and give a more
extensive overview of the context, data, methods and findings. You
should provide context by referencing the existing literature regarding
the things that we know and things that we do not know and then parlay
the latter part into your research question. You need to interest your
reader to a degree that they would want to continue reading the rest of
your paper. The \textbf{Introduction} is said to the most important part
of the paper, as you have to grab the readers' attention.

The \textbf{Previous literature review} are standard in economic papers.
They are either included in the \textbf{Introduction} or are placed in a
separate section. It contains a critical review of the most relevant and
influential (well-cited) studies on the topic. It should also contain a
summary and a connection how your study is related to what has been done
before and how your study is going to contribute to it.

A significant part of your empirical project is conducting a thorough
literature review. Once you choose your topic and pose a research
question, one of the first thing you usually do is look at the previous
research and theories related to the research problem. By doing this,
you will create a comprehensive overview of all the published knowledge
on your topic available to date. This will provide a description,
summary, background, context, relevance, and critical evaluation to the
research idea you are working on. The main purpose of the review is to
provide an overview of sources you are considering and to convince the
reader of the need to conduct the research in question, and to show how
it fits into the larger field of study. It will help you to establish
whether the topic has been researched before, and show what problems
others faced during their research.

In a literature review, you need to identify and summarize key scholarly
publications from the fields that are pertinent to your research topic.
It should involve a thorough search of the main key words in the
relevant databases and journals.

The \textbf{Data} and variables section should contain a detailed
information about the data source used in the paper as well as
information about the variables used in the analysis.

Describe the data you are using in your study in great detail. Is it a
secondary data? Did you collect it yourself, if yes, how? Describe your
sample and variable selection.

The \textbf{Empirical method} section should in great detail describe
the statistical method used in the paper and the assumptions that are
necessary to be fulfilled in order to get an unbiased and consistent
estimation of your parameter of interest. Also describe the limitations
and how you addressed them.

Ideally, you should describe each step that readers should perform, if
they would like to reproduce your results and conclusions.

The \textbf{Results} section should contain a set of tables and figures
that show your empirical results. Make sure that tables are
reader-friendly and are easy to comprehend. Place figures and tables as
close as possible to the place in the text where you first referred to
them.

Do not discuss or explain the results in this section, and do not
provide any interpretation or speculation here. Keep it factual and
simply describe in words what the tables display.

The \textbf{Discussion} section should contain the interpretation and
discussion of the results, as well as potential mechanisms, and suggest
a direction for future research.

You should start your discussion by reiterating your research question
and based on your findings, state what you think an answer to your
question is. Do not introduce any new data or results in this section.
It should reflect only the results already presented in the paper. You
need to interpret your results in the context of the literature that you
identified and discussed in the Introduction and the Related Literature
sections.

Are your findings consistent with what the other literature have found?
Do your data fill the gap in the knowledge that you identified? Here you
want to show how your work added to and extended the knowledge on the
topic.

You can also discuss implications of your study, for example for public
policy. You also should acknowledge and discuss the limitations of the
study here and what implications these limitations might have for the
results. The more accurate, open and detailed you are about the
limitations, the more credibility your results will have. Offer any
alternative explanations for your findings.

Discuss any negative effects in your findings and the impact they had on
your conclusion. You can also talk about next steps and the implications
of your findings for future research.

The \textbf{Summary and conclusion} section is usually short and
contains the most important information on the topic, findings and
concluding remarks. It should reflect main points mentioned in the
Introduction.

Here you should underline why your research matters and state the answer
to your research question. Also state here any recommendations that can
be made based on your findings.

At the very end of your paper you need to provide a complete list of
\textbf{References}. The bibliography includes a compete list of
academic papers and books referenced and cited in your study.

The easiest way to keep track of your reference list is to write down
the information, i.e.~the title, author(s), journal/book, publisher, and
publication date, about the original source each time you use it. Decide
in advance on one citation and reference style and follow it throughout
the paper.

The \textbf{Appendices} are a handy tool. In order to keep your main
part of the paper focused, of reasonable length, and not overburdened,
you can place all the still relevant, but secondary and less critical
information, i.e.~various robustness checks, descriptive statistics,
etc., in appendices.

As a careful researcher you will conduct and document a number of
various robustness checks of your main results. However, once you
confirm and verified that your results are robust, it does not make
sense to keep all of the robustness checks in the main body of the
paper. Appendices allow you to save space. You can just summarize hat
you did and refer to the tables in the appendix. Some journals also
provide possibilities of online appendix.

\subsection{The writing process}\label{the-writing-process}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  producing a good empirical paper takes time. You should start working
  on it and drafting as soon as possible.
\item
  allow yourself sufficient time for collecting and analyzing the data,
  writing and revising the paper. Writing a paper is a recursive process
  that will take many revisions.
\item
  read the text yourself and let others read it. (``Is the text fun to
  read?'', ``Would I want to read beyond the introduction myself?'',
  ``Are the questions guiding the research comprehensible?'')
\item
  keep it short. When editing ask yourself whether you can make the same
  point using fewer words?
\item
  avoid repetition. Repeating things uses extra space and tests readers'
  patience.\\
\item
  use ``I'' in a single-author project, and ``we'' in the project with
  more than one author.
\end{itemize}

\item
  use simple and direct sentences. Keep them short.
\item
  check your paper for repetition and cut whenever you detect it in your

We show the results of the reproduction of tables 1-3 and figures 1-2 of
the descriptive analysis, and the reproduction of the empirical analysis
in table 4-6. Please keep in mind that our results are based on data
from 1991. This in contrast to Hellerstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hellerstein_importance_1998}{1998}) which is
based on three datasets of the year 1989. As the confidential data is
key to identifying physicians and patients in the data of 1989 we resort
to the 1991 data, that provides these identifiers in two publically
available datasets. We present our results and discuss the differences
compared to Hellerstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hellerstein_importance_1998}{1998}) briefly. For
a detailed discussion and interpretation of the results, we refer to the
original study by Hellerstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hellerstein_importance_1998}{1998}).

\hypertarget{descriptive-analysis}{%
\subsection{Descriptive Analysis}\label{descriptive-analysis}}

The summary statistics shown in Table 1, representing the overall NAMCS
patient sample of the year 1991 are similar to the summary statistics
shown by Hellerstein (1998). When looking at the dristribution of
insurance coverage, we see differences especially at Blue Cross/Blue
Shield (\(2%
\) compared to \(13%
\) in 1989), other commercial insurer (\(38%
\) compared to \(24%
\) in 1989) and HMO/prepaid plan (14\% compared to \(24%
\) in 1989). Additionally, about \(14%
\) more specialist physicians are represented by the sample.

proportion of generic drug prescription in specialist compared to
Hellerstein (1998).

Compared to 1989, we observe larger sample size in the 1991 data. Table
3 shows the absolute number of observations and the share of generics
over all drugs as well as the 8 largest drug categories. While the
absolute number of observations is higher, the share of generics overall
and per drug class stays similar to Hellerstein (1998).

\end{figure}

The distribution of physicians over the different generic prescription
rates (figure 1) is similar to Hellerstein (1998). When looking at
figure 2, we see an decrease from about 90\% to about 50\% in ``only
trade name'' prescriptions by physicians. This seems to be driven by a
rather small increase of prescription of ``both versions'' an ``only
generics''.

\subsection{Empirical Analysis}\label{empirical-analysis}}

In the following we present our results of the empirical analyses.
Please keep in mind, that, due to data restrictions, we were not able to
control for some covariates that Hellerstein (1998) accounted for. An
example of such are legislation laws like mandatory or permissive
substitution or one- or two-line prescription. For this reason, we
cannot present all tables produced by Hellerstein (1998). Given these
restrictions, we cannot run the analysis with the same underlying model
specifications. This restricts us from comparing the results of the
years 1991 and 1989, however for the completion of this example we
represent the results of table 4, 5 and 6 in the following:
